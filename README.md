ToothTimerPro
=============

Pebble app for timing the brushing of teeth with settings so you are able to select how long and which areas you want to brush.

It shows different parts of the mouth (upper right outer, lower left inner, etc) with a countdown timer for how long
to focus on it, along with a brief delay at the start to get ready, and a brief delay halfway through to spit.

It vibrates between each step so you don't have to watch the watch while you're brushing.
